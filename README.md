# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Project

This project involves building machine learning models to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical data. We applied and compared the performance of three classifiers:

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, which contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating whether a person has diabetes.

**Features:**
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

**Target:**
- `0` - Non-diabetic
- `1` - Diabetic

## ðŸ§  Models Used

### ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression (LR)
- Acts as a strong baseline
- Easy to interpret
- Suitable for linearly separable data

### ðŸ”¹ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Works well with non-linear data using kernel trick

### ðŸ”¹ Random Forest
- An ensemble learning method
- Handles overfitting better
- Captures complex feature interactions
